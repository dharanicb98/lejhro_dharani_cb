        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Data privacy is a crucial aspect of modern information systems.
          Ensuring the privacy of data is essential to protect sensitive
          information from unauthorized access and breaches.
        </p>
        <h2>Statistical Disclosure Control (SDC)</h2>
        <p>
          SDC involves modifying the data in such a way that the risk of
          disclosure of sensitive information is minimized while preserving the
          utility of the data for analysis.
        </p>
        <h2>Differential Privacy</h2>
        <p>
          Differential privacy provides a framework for measuring the privacy
          guarantees provided by a particular data analysis algorithm. It
          ensures that the output of the algorithm does not reveal too much
          information about any single individual in the dataset.
        </p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Various statistical approaches play a vital role in ensuring data
          privacy. These techniques help in balancing the trade-off between data
          utility and privacy protection.
